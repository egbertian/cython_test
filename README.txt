1. Start with solution.py
2. Try to run it using the commented out line at the bottom - it's just some useless calculations that take a while
3. python console comamnds:
    -> run something: python solution.py
    -> install a module: python -m pip install modulename
4. Follow the link at the top which begins a cython walkthrough
5. You'll have to create a .pyx file, *name it solution_cy.pyx*
6. There's another console command in the walkthough that will compile the c++ part
7. test.py runs both the python version and the cython version and compares the times - you'll notice that the cython one is faster
